# Check if agilepy REST API allows to download data.

**Repository structure**
- [Targets.yml](./Targets.yml): YAML file with the different targets used for the analysis (target= source position + time intervals requested for download and scientific analysis).
Every target is associated with a progressive number from `0` onward.
- [WriteConfFile.py](./WriteConfFile.py): script used to create the Agilepy Configuration files necessary to start an analysis.
It can be run as
    ```
    python WriteConfFile.py -t 0
    ```
    Change `0` with the progressive number of the Target you are interested in.
    Configuration files are wirtten in [ConfigurationFiles](./ConfigurationFiles/).
- [DownloadData.py](./DownloadData.py): Read the Agilepy Configuration file created for a given target and tries to download the data with the REST API.
It can be run as
    ```
    python DownloadData.py -t 0
    ```
    Change `0` with the progressive number of the Target you are interested in.
    Data are downloaded in [DataFiles](./DataFiles/), though the `.gz` fits files are ignored in this repository to keep it light.
Download is performed when calling `AGAnalysis.generateMaps()`.

- Logs of program executions are stored in [Logs](./Logs/).
